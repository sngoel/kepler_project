### Clean and Load Data
Reads in data, turns drink name into ascii to remove tradmark value in drink data set. The beverage name, Bevarge size, and how the beverage was made, was then transformed into digits and letters using regualr expressions
```{r}
# read data https://www.kaggle.com/starbucks/starbucks-menu
drinks_expanded <- read.csv('starbucks_drinkMenu_expanded.csv')
food <- read.csv('starbucks-menu-nutrition-food.csv')

# as the data seems to contains some trademarks and accent, we will first remove them
drinks_expanded$Beverage_category <- iconv (drinks_expanded$Beverage_category, "latin1", "ASCII", sub = "byte")
drinks_expanded$Beverage <- iconv (drinks_expanded$Beverage, "latin1", "ASCII", sub = "byte")
drinks_expanded$Beverage_prep <- iconv (drinks_expanded$Beverage_prep, "latin1", "ASCII", sub = "byte")

drinks_expanded$Beverage_category <- gsub ('(<[a-z0-9]+>)','',drinks_expanded$Beverage_category)
drinks_expanded$Beverage <- gsub ('(<[a-z0-9]+>)','',drinks_expanded$Beverage)
drinks_expanded$Beverage_prep <- gsub ('(<[a-z0-9]+>)','',drinks_expanded$Beverage_prep)
```

#### Checking for missing values
It doesnt seems the data contains any missing values. However, Caffeine variable in the `Drinks Expanded` dataset seems to be a mixed of numeric and character. As it can be seen, there are values with value `varies` or `Varies` in the data. Removed them from the dataset and will format it into numeric variable.

```{r, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, echo=FALSE}
summary (drinks_expanded)
summary (food)
drinks_expanded <- subset (drinks_expanded, !Caffeine %in% c ('Varies', 'varies', ''))
drinks_expanded$Caffeine <- as.numeric (as.character (drinks_expanded$Caffeine))
```

#### Distribution of the variables in each of the datasets
Drinks expanded dataset, shown by histogram of each feature 
```{r ggplot, fig.width=14, fig.height=8, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, echo=FALSE}
drinks_expanded %>% 
    select (-contains ("Beverage")) %>% 
    mutate (dummy = 1) %>% 
    melt (id = 'dummy') %>%
    mutate (value=as.numeric (value)) %>% 
    ggplot (aes (value)) + 
    geom_histogram (color = 'white', fill = 'red') + 
    facet_wrap (~variable, scales = 'free', ncol = 5) + 
    theme_bw () +
    labs (x = 'Value',y = 'Frequency',title = 'Drinks Expanded Variables Histograms')+
    theme(
        legend.text = element_text(size=11),
        legend.position = "top",
        legend.title = element_blank(),
        axis.text.x = element_text(size=12),
        axis.text.y = element_text(size=12),
        axis.title.x = element_text(size=12),
        axis.title.y = element_text(size=12),
        strip.text.y = element_text(size=12),
        strip.text.x = element_text(size=12),
        plot.title = element_text(size=15))
```

###Food dataset
Histogram of each feature in the Starbucks Food data set 
```{r fig.width=14, fig.height=4, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, echo=FALSE}
food %>% 
    select (-contains("Food")) %>% 
    mutate (dummy=1) %>% 
    melt (id='dummy') %>%
    mutate (value = as.numeric(value)) %>% 
    ggplot (aes (value)) + 
    geom_histogram (color = 'white', fill = 'red') + 
    facet_wrap (~variable, scales = 'free', ncol = 5) + 
    theme_bw () +
    labs(x = 'Value', y = 'Frequency',title = 'Food Variables Histograms')+
    theme(
        legend.text = element_text(size=11),
        legend.position = "top",
        legend.title = element_blank(),
        axis.text.x = element_text(size=12),
        axis.text.y = element_text(size=12),
        axis.title.x = element_text(size=12),
        axis.title.y = element_text(size=12),
        strip.text.y = element_text(size=12),
        strip.text.x = element_text(size=12),
        plot.title=element_text(size=15))
```

### Supervised learning
Fit linear model to predict number of Calories in a drink based on other variables such as
Total_Fat, Trans_Fat. Sugars etc.
5 folds cross validation Used and will use `MAPE` (mean average error percentage) as the perforamce metrics. Once we have the `MAPE` for each fold, I will simply take the average of all folds and this will be the final `MAPE` 
```{r warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
# randomly shuffle the data, set seed to produce the same resultss
# in addition, remove the first 3 columns which contains the Beverage descriptions
set.seed (380)
drinks_expanded <- drinks_expanded[sample(nrow(drinks_expanded)),] %>% 
  select (-contains("Beverage"))

# create 5 equally size folds
K <- 5
folds <- cut (seq (1, nrow (drinks_expanded)), breaks = K, labels = FALSE)

# Perform 5 folds cross validation
MAPE <- c ()
for (i in 1:K){
    index <- which (folds==i, arr.ind=TRUE)
    train <- drinks_expanded[-index, ]
    test <- drinks_expanded[index, ]
    model <- lm (Calories ~., data=train)
    prediction <- predict (model,test)
    MAPE[i] <- abs (test$Calories / prediction - 1)
}

paste0 ('MAPE for 5 folds: ', round (mean (MAPE)*100, 2),'%')

```

### Unspurviesd learning
for the unspurviesd part, I will use the food dataset.
We will use "Hierarchical Clustering" in order to find clusters of similiar foods based on
`Calories`, `Fat`, `Carb`, `Fiver` and `Protein`
```{r fig.width=24, fig.height=15, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
# remove the food column 
df <- food %>% 
  select (-Food.name)
# set food column as the row names
rownames (df) <- food$Food.name

# scale the data and create distance metrics using euclidean distance.
dd <- dist (scale (df), method = "euclidean")

# fit hierarchical clustering using "ward.D2" method
hc <- hclust (dd, method = "ward.D2")

# plot the results
par (cex = 1, mar = c (2, 2, 4, 1))
plot (hc, 
     hang = -1, 
     cex = 1.4, 
     xlab = "", 
     sub = "", 
     axes = FALSE, 
     ylab = '', 
     main = 'Food HierarChial Cluster Diagram',
     cex.main = 2)
```

### Simulation
Simulation using sampling with replacement, bootstrap, simulates 365 days for eating 3 meals and drinking 3 drinks a day, examines total sugar, caleries, fat, carbohydrates, and caffine. Histograms show distribution of nutrion facts per day where the red line is the recomendation by the Federal Goverment, citation is first line.
```{r}

  total_sugar <- sum (drink_samp$Sugars)
  total_caffine <- sum (drink_samp$Caffeine)
  total_calories <- sum (food_samp$Calories) + sum (drink_samp$Calories)
  total_fat <- sum (food_samp$Fat) + sum (drink_samp$Total_Fat)
  total_carbo <- sum (food_samp$Carb) + sum (drink_samp$Total_Carbohydrates)
  
  # index 1 sugar
